# WASABI Song Corpus - BPM Prediction Classifier

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a classifier to predict Beats Per Minute (BPM) based on a song's title using the WASABI Song Corpus. The classifier will utilize a PyTorch model to analyze song titles and make predictions solely based on this textual information.

## How to Use

1. **Dataset Acquisition:**
   - Obtain the WASABI Song Corpus for training and testing. Ensure the dataset includes song titles and corresponding BPM values.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Use the provided PyTorch model script to train the BPM prediction model. Adjust hyperparameters as needed.

3. **Prediction:**
   - After training, use the model to make predictions on new song titles to estimate their BPM.

## Usage Disclaimer
